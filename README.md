A Python text-based adventure game that uses various data structures to tell a meaningful story
of navigating through inner demons and finding hope.

## 🧾 Overview
Soul Dungeon is more than just a game – it's a metaphorical journey representing the struggles
with depression, anxiety, and the path to healing.

---

## 🛠️ Data Structures Implemented
- **Lists & Matrices**: The game map (2D matrix) and player inventory (1D list)  
- **Recursion**: Fog of war and pathfinding algorithms  
- **Functions & Loops**: Main game loop and command processing  
- **Linked Lists**: Memory/journal system tracking the player's journey  
- **Stacks & Queues**: Undo feature (stack) and turn-based events (queue)  

---

## 🎮 Controls
- **Arrow Keys** → Move in four directions  
- **Command Keys**:  
  - `l` → Look around  
  - `i` → Check inventory  
  - `t` → Take item (when available)

👉 Do you want me to also include a **screenshot/demo section** so it feels more “alive” on GitHub?
